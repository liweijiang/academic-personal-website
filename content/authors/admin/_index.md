I am a Ph.D. student at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu), advised by Professor [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). I am also a student researcher at [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2)](https://allenai.org). I earned B.A. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematics from [Colby College](http://www.colby.edu). During my undergraduate studies, I worked on [Smart Primer](https://hci.stanford.edu/research/smartprimer/) at [Stanford University HCI group](https://hci.stanford.edu).
<!-- 
My primary field of study is **natural language processing (NLP)**, currently focusing on commonsense knowledge reasoning, connotative language understanding, and conversational applications for social good, such as education and healthcare.

My **long-term research goal** is threefold: computationally investigating meaningful & interesting phenomena in the world, innovatively bridging language, human cognitions & behaviors and world knowledge through an interdisciplinary lense, and applying AI advances to boost positive social impact. -->

My primary fields of study are **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **natural language processing (NLP)**. I'm intrigued to make wild imaginations come true by building AI & orchestrate mathematical and philosophical rigor to tackle real-world needs & understand the charms, mysteries, and peculiarities of humans. Thus, my current research focuses on the **co-evolution of AI and humanity**: developing AI systems with deep concerns for human *traits*, *values*, and *needs*, while gleaning novel insights into *humans*, *society*, and *humanity* through advancing AI.

My **long-term research goal** is threefold:
(1) Computationally investigating meaningful & engaging phenomena in humans and society to add new insights to humanity.
(2) Inventing and engineering better AI by bridging language, multimodal information, human cognitions, behaviors, philosophical insights, world knowledge, mathematical formulations, etc., through an interdisciplinary lens.
(3) Advancing AI applications to boost positive social impact.
