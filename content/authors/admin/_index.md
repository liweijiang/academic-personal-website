I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu), advised by Professor [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/). I am also a graduate research intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com). I was a student researcher at [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2)](https://allenai.org). I earned B.A. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematics from [Colby College](http://www.colby.edu).


 <!-- During my undergraduate studies, I worked on [Smart Primer](https://hci.stanford.edu/research/smartprimer/) at [Stanford University HCI group](https://hci.stanford.edu). -->

My research centers on **humanistic AI safety**, aiming to foster the synergistic, secure, and sustainable coexistence of AI and society---ultimately shaping the **co-evolution of AI and humanity**:

**From Human to AI:** Developing human-centered, continually-evolving, and future-proof AI systems---drawing upon interdisciplinary insights into human intelligence, values, and global needs.

**From AI to Human:** Advancing the frontiers of knowledge about individuals and society, augmenting human capabilities, and addressing humanity's most consequential sociotechnical challenges---through robust, efficient, and scalable innovations in data, learning algorithms, and system design.


My **current** research encompasses topics such as pluralistic alignment, self-improving algorithms for steerable and secure language models, anticipatory strategies for long-term risks---including overreliance and the erosion of human creativity---and socially impactful applications, such as clinical AI.




<!-- I do research in **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **natural language processing (NLP)**. I'm intrigued to make wild imaginations come true by building AI + orchestrating mathematical and philosophical rigor to tackle real-world needs + understanding the charms, mysteries, and peculiarities of humans. I aspire to achieve a **co-evolution of AI and humanity**: developing AI systems with deep concerns for human *traits*, *values*, and *needs*, while gleaning novel insights into *humans*, *society*, and *humanity* through advancing AI. -->

<!-- My **long-term research goal** is threefold: -->

<!-- (1) Inventing and engineering better AI by bridging language, multimodality, human cognitions, behaviors, philosophical insights, world knowledge, dynamic interactions, mathematical formulations, etc., through an interdisciplinary lens and in a scalable manner. -->

<!-- (2) Computationally investigating meaningful & engaging phenomena in humans and society to add new insights to humanity. -->
 
<!-- (3) Advancing AI applications to enhance positive social impact while ensuring robust safety and versatile alignment with all.



My **current research focuses** include:

(1) Pursuing AI that embraces the *diverse* need of *all* people.

(2) Investigating alternative paths toward enhancing the *robustness* of AI safety beyond current safety alignment paradigms. -->


> *I'm forever thankful to the people who have mentored me. Thus, feel free to reach out to me for undergrads and junior researchers who are interested in my work.*
